### IR Infrared Sensor

#### Project Overview

The IR Infrared Sensor project demonstrates how to use an infrared sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect obstacles. The infrared sensor provides a digital output, which changes state when it detects an obstacle. This project reads the sensor state and triggers a buzzer to sound an alarm when an obstacle is detected. Additionally, the sensor state is printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging purposes.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **IR Infrared Sensor Module**
- **Buzzer**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

**Block Diagram Title:** IR Infrared Sensor Module Connection Diagram

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the IR Infrared Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the IR sensor module to digital pin 2 (`irSensorPin`) on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the IR sensor module to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the IR sensor module to **GND** on Arduino Mega

2. **Connect the Buzzer to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Positive Pin** of the buzzer to digital pin 3 (`buzzerPin`) on Arduino Mega
   - **Negative Pin** of the buzzer to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the IR sensor module and buzzer to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for messages indicating the state of the IR sensor module.
   - When an obstacle is detected, the buzzer will sound an alarm.

#### Applications

- **Obstacle Detection:** Use in projects requiring obstacle detection for navigation or safety purposes.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate into security systems to detect unauthorized access or presence.
- **Automation:** Implement in automation projects to trigger actions based on obstacle detection.

#### Notes

- Ensure the IR sensor is positioned correctly to detect obstacles effectively.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of sensor readings based on your project requirements.
- Test the sensor with various obstacles to ensure it is working correctly and calibrate if necessary.
